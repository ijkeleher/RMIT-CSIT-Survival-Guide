# RMIT-CSIT-Survival-Guide
A collection of tips and tricks for RMIT CSIT students

## Import your Calendar

First thing you should do -> Import your **calendar** from myTimetable to google cal/iOS calendar/whatever this lets you always know where your class is instead of fumbling with printouts you keep losing.

    Go to myAllocate/myTimetable and under LiveCal -> Subscribe 
    you'll see a link you can paste into your google/apple calendar
    if you're on a mac you can also use something like itsycal to 
    view it from the menuBar using that same link.

## Bash and Unix

Learn **bash/unix.** This will become ever more essential as time goes on but you should start as soon as possible. If you are using **Windows** then install a **VM (virtual machine)** and use something like **Ubuntu**. You could also use **GitBash**. If you are on a **mac** then just open up the default **terminal** app. 

Learn the simple **bash** commands like 

    ls, cd, mkdir, touch

Learn to use **package managers** like **homebrew** (mac) or **pacman** (linux) this will make installing packages and software dependencies much easier.

Learn how to use **ssh** to connect to the school server *saturn.csit.rmit.edu.au* that is used for assessments and **scp** to quickly copy files.

    // to connect, replace s123456 with your student number
    $ ssh -l s123456 saturn.csit.rmit.edu.au

    //to copy files to the remote server
    $scp -r ~/localdirectoryname/ ~/locationonserver 

## Programming

If you're learning **Java** for the first time ever you may get a lot of use out of this youtube series by **Derek Banas**, probably one of the best programming tutorial channels on youtube -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPvGqX-TXP0

A lot of opinionated and more advanced students will be using editors like **VSCode** and **Vim**. You're better off just sticking with **Eclipse** until you start learning non-java programming.

Learn how to use **git** and **GitHub** as soon as you possibly can and back up **ALL** of your assignment work on **GitHub** using a **PRIVATE repo**. If you don't understand any of that paragraph watch this video -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63f51ce84A or go to the **CSIT mentor room** and they'll teach you. It doesn't really matter if you use **git** from the **terminal** or a **desktop tool** but **terminal** is arguably less complicated.

Finally, go to the **CSIT mentoring room** OFTEN and go as SOON as possible (i.e. not when your assignment is overdue!) They're open from **10am until 6pm** and they will help you **FOR FREE**. They can help you with your lab work, tutorial work, **setting up your developer environment** and your assignments. Make a habit of going every week. 

## Maths
If you need **mathematics** help you can also go to the **MATH DROP-IN CENTRE** locating at **Swanston Library** in Building 8/10 Level 5 -> https://www.rmit.edu.au/students/study-support/study-and-learning-centre/drop-in

## Assignments
p.s. **START YOUR ASSIGNMENTS AT LEAST A WEEK BEFORE THEY ARE DUE. ESPECIALLY THE ROBOT ASSIGNMENT FOR PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUES! IF YOU NEED EXTENSIONS THEY NEED TO BE REQUESTED IN ADVANCE OF THE DUE DATE**

Good luck.
